README FOR JAVA ASSIGNMENNT TWO:

Due to theÂ TestApp.java file, two new methods are introduced to the Person class. 
 Student objects are created by referencing the Person class. As a result, 
 these objects cannot invoke methods that are not specified in the Person class. 
 As a result, empty methods have been added to the Person class.

The code in the TestApp.java file has been modified to get the desired result;
otherwise, the code was creating problems.

Furthermore, two courses with the same course code but distinct course numbers can exist.
In the TestApp.java code, the method printStudentsRegisteredInCourse() was invoked using the course number as an input.
As a result, the functions printStudentsRegisteredInCourse() and studentsRegisteredInCourse() have been modified to accept course number rather than course code as an argument.
